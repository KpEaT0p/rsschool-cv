## About me:

**Even in my school years, my interest in programming gradually grew.** 

**After graduating from college, I got a job at a factory, where I worked 
for two years. I realized that it was not my thing, but I got important 
skills - stress resistance and responsibility, which helped me a lot.
Stress tolerance and responsibility that have helped me to this day. A
ll this time I continued my training.** 

**I moved to Tashkent, where I got a job at a restaurant automation company.
Here I was already doing networking and system administration.**

**I feel that I have reached my peak in the technical department of our 
company, so I am striving for new heights.**

## Task code

### Convert string to camel case:
*Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore
delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output
should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized
(known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case).
The next words should be always capitalized.*

```def to_camel_case(text):
    text = list(text)
    new_text = []
    flag = 0
    for i in range(len(text)):
        if text[i] == '_':
            flag = 1
            new_text.append(text[i + 1].upper())
        elif text[i] == "-":
            flag = 1
            new_text.append(text[i + 1].upper())
        elif not flag:
            new_text.append(text[i])
        else:
            flag = 0
    return ''.join(new_text)
    
```
