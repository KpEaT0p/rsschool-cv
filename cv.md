## About me:

*Worked in a factory for 2 years, realized that it's not my thing.*

*In the courses I got confident knowledge of Python (OOP, Git,
working with libraries/relational databases).
As a hobby during that time I made a bot (based on asynchronous 
library aiogram) for the group (which controlled the flow of people,
registering them and other little things).*

*In another course I learned basic information about the database
and practiced with MySQL queries (before that I worked with PostgreSQL).*

*In the third course I got acquainted with Selenium WebDriver. 
The acquired knowledge: launching different browsers, searching 
for elements, getting their properties, actions with elements,
waiting, working with alert's and frames.
I know the POM model. I have run tests on virtual machines.*

*I also know Linux.*

*Recently gained a solid understanding of R-Keeper and everything 
related to it in a short amount of time.*
