## About me:

**Even in my school years, my interest in programming gradually grew.** 

**After graduating from college, I got a job at a factory, where I worked 
for two years. I realized that it was not my thing, but I got important 
skills - stress resistance and responsibility, which helped me a lot.
Stress tolerance and responsibility that have helped me to this day. A
ll this time I continued my training.** 

**I moved to Tashkent, where I got a job at a restaurant automation company.
Here I was already doing networking and system administration.**

**I feel that I have reached my peak in the technical department of our 
company, so I am striving for new heights.**
